# 📊 Sentiment Analysis using Python & NLP

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **Sentiment Analysis** to classify text data into categories such as **positive, negative, or neutral**.  
It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for text preprocessing and **Machine Learning algorithms** for sentiment classification.  
The goal is to help analyze opinions from sources like **tweets, product reviews, or customer feedback**.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocesses raw text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization).  
- Converts text into numerical features using **Bag of Words / TF-IDF vectorization**.  
- Trains multiple ML models (**Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM**) for comparison.  
- Evaluates models using **accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**.  
- Visualizes sentiment distribution with **Matplotlib/Seaborn**.
